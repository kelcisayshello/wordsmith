# Wordsmith: Your Quick & Simple Text Formatting Sidekick 🪄
This is a Lexical.js-powered rich text editor that lets users focus on writing content ✍️ while providing easy-to-access tools for quick and speedy formatting. ✨ Wordsmith is great for drafting simple emails, taking a quick note, or tidying up plain text before pasting it elsewhere.
